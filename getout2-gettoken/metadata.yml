  Welcome back, human! If you're here, it means you were issued your copy of
  Get Out Solutions. Congratulations! You're on your way to Space Paradise!

  You should have received a username and password via The System. The next
  step to getting out is to log into the system and get your special token.
  Fire up your "Get Out Solutions" tool, and set it to use the `gettoken`
  service.

  That token will be required, so you should get it as soon as possible.
