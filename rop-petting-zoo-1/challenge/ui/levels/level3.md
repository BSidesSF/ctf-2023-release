Welcome to the final level!

You should see a new function on the left, `write_flag_to_file()`. It does
exactly what it promises, and returns the filename in `rax`. Can you open that
file, read the contents, and write it to stdout (just like in the last
tutorial)?

Note that this is a very similar ROP chain to ones I've used in real-world
exploits (and CTFs)! If you get this, you've built a very realistic ROP chain
and you should be proud. :)

Good luck!
