disk.ssd is a BCC Micro floppy disk image (Acorn DFS filesystem).

There is a directory named P with a series of images in it.

Using https://github.com/monkeyman79/dfsimage

$ ./dfsimage list -v ~/projects/github/ctf-2023/acorn/distfiles/disk.ssd
GALLERY      (85)
Drive 0             Option 3 (EXEC)
Dir. :0.$           Lib. :0.$


  P.ALBERT            P.BEEB
  P.BIRD              P.BSIDES
  P.CAR               P.CAT
  P.FLAG              P.MANDRIL
  P.MONARCH           P.ZEBRA


P.FLAG is an image (320x256 4 colors) that contains the flag.

$ ./dfsimage dump -v ~/projects/github/ctf-2023/acorn/distfiles/disk.ssd P.FLAG > /tmp/out.bin

The only tricky thing is that images are not encoded row by
row. Instead they are encoded 8x8 pixels at a time (like characters):

Software to decode is available at:

The flag is very bold and easy to spot so the image doesn't need to be
decoded very precisely to read the flag.

Flag is CTF{OLDSKOOL}
