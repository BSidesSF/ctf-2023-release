  It's happened! The "Get Out" program has begun! A select number of humans
  will be saved from your dying planet and brought to Space Paradise. Humans
  wishing to escape must obtain a copy of the software package, "Get Out
  Solutions". Packages have been distributed to your world governments.

  To test the software, please configure it to connect to the service listed
  below, and run the `ping` function.

  > (*bzzzt*...*bzzzzzzt*....are you receiving this? There's more to the "Get
  > Out" program than meets the eye. None of us are getting "Get Out
  > Solutions". But *I* have access to the server-side packages - I think it's
  > just an RPC server. Can you help me figure out how to run their `ping` RPC
