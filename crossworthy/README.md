This is a crossword puzzle! I (Ron) wrote it over the course of a few days.
It's the first time I've made a puzzle, and I'm reasonably happy with it!

It's slightly oversized for a weekday, but I tried to keep the difficulty as
low as I could. People who solve a lot of crosswords will find this very easy,
but beginners will probably struggle a bit - it takes time to learn the
"language".

The software is called CrossFire - that's what the .cfp extension is. But the
.ipuz format is fairly well understood and should be possible to open in other
software.
