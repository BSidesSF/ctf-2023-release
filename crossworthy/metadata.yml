  Solve the crossword! It's attached to this challenge in a variety of formats,
  and you can also find it in the physical program at the conference!

  The four long symmetric answers (with circles in them) form the "theme"
  answers, and have special parenthetical clues. The parenthetical clues refer
  specifically to the circled letters, which form visual representations of
  four common security attacks - can you figure them out?

  The flag for this challenge is `CTF{word1-word2-word3-word4}`, where the four
  words are the circled letters in the "theme" answers.

  This puzzle tries to use [standard conventions for American
  crosswords](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/tips-and-tricks). You can find
  some hints on solving this style of puzzle
  [here](https://www.nytimes.com/guides/crosswords/how-to-solve-a-crossword-puzzle)!
  Don't be afraid to look up answers if you aren't a cross-nerd. :)
